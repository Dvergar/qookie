# Qookie

Qookie is a socket abstraction for NME in order to reflect the same behaviour as the flash socket library.

All methods are not supported yet.

Roadmap :
* Isolate qookie from NME, making a qookie-openfl lib or something
* More unit-tests, behaviour tests
* haxe3 compatible
* openfl compatible
* hiding it behind openfl.net.socket ?
